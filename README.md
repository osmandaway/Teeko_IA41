# Teeko

AI Project - Fall 2022

Created by: ERASLAN Hakan, GAYGUSUZ Osman, GOUDAL Victor, MAURER Gilles

Team Project of 4

Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This project involves creating a Teeko game where you can play against a computer or let two computers compete against each other. The algorithm applied is the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. An initial attempt at implementing self-learning has been made, but it requires further optimization. The computer's difficulty level is adjustable based on the depth of the search tree.

Included:

The project’s source code
A report with a more detailed presentation of the project
The presentation slides used for the defense, which cover challenges faced and potential improvements

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things to do :

    - Do the graphic rendering (only useful when the player is human)

    - Do the Alpha–beta pruning

    - Implement "Deep learning" to the early game part
        (by saving each move in early game, if victory then add 1 to the corresponding cells else remove 1 (defeat). Then run program many time and after place pions in cells with the best scores)
        
Problem encountered :

    - One bot is attacking, the other is defending and they both swich between 2 moves
    - Also the bot with heuristique create redendancy
