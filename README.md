# Teeko


Things to do :

    - Do the graphic rendering (only useful when the player is human)

    - Do the Alphaâ€“beta pruning

    - Implement "Deep learning" to the early game part
        (by saving each move in early game, if victory then add 1 to the corresponding cells else remove 1 (defeat). Then run program many time and after place pions in cells with the best scores)
        
Problem encountered :

    - One bot is attacking, the other is defending and they both swich between 2 moves
    - Also the bot with heuristique create redendancy
